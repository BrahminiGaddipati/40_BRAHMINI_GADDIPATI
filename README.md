**Project Title :** AI Patient Safety Companion (Agentic AI)

**Problem Statement:**
Hospitals generate massive amounts of clinical notes, prescriptions, and discharge summaries.
However, patients often misunderstand medical instructions, which leads to:
Incorrect medication usage
Ignoring dangerous symptoms
Increased hospital re-admissions
This project presents an AI Patient Safety Companion using Agentic AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help patients safely understand medical instructions without providing diagnoses.

**Solution Overview**
We designed an Agentic AI system powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that:
Retrieves relevant information from:Doctor notes,Drug labels,Discharge instructions
Answers patient questions like:
“Can I take this medicine at night?”
“What symptoms should I worry about?”
Enforces medical safety guardrails
Generates a structured action plan for patients
**The system does NOT diagnose diseases and always includes emergency disclaimers.**
